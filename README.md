#Brief Description
Our idea is to use data from Reddit to find words commonly associated with a certain topic. The purpose will be to find the overall opinion of any entry (sentiment analysis).

# Stages
Stage 1: Acquire data from Reddit's API somehow.

Stage 2: Identify names of products within threads (i.e. movies)

Stage 3: Check unique reoccuring words within comments of the thread. Check whether the words have a positive or negative association (if applicable).

Stage 4: Find an overall score for the product and display the score, most common positive/negative associated words, reliability, and controversy.
